SERVER MODE --->
To launch the server you must first run the RMIRegistry, but due to Java RMI idiosyncrocies yoU will first need 
to set the CLASSPATH so that RMIregistry knows to look inside the .jar file for the application classes.  
To do this open a seperate command prompt and navigate to the projects root folder. 
Reset the CLASSPATH to the .jar file e.g. 

set CLASSPATH=H:\SJDwork\90045985\runme.jar


Then type "rmiregistry" into the command line and press [return]

From a seperate command prompt, navigate to the root directory and execute the .jar file using the parameter "server":

java -jar runme.jar server


When dialog window appears enter the location of the servers database into the text box in the standard convention 
for java programs(\\ instead of \) e.g."H:\\SJDwork\\MF_SJD\\db-2x2_WORKING.db".

Then enter a port number for the server to use.  
If you wish to test on a local machine use port 0.

Selecting [Start Server] will attempt to connect to the specified database, and register with the RMIRegistry.
If a connection fails a message is returned in the text label at the bottom of the dialog box.  If the connection
is successful the [Start Server] button, path and port boxes become disabled.

Leave the server running until you no longer wish to access the database from a client and press [Exit] or using 
the close button in the top right corner.

NETWORK DATABASE MODE --->

In order to run the application in networked mode the Server and RMIRegistry must already be running.

To launch the application in network database mode, navigate to the root directory and execute the .jar file from the command line with no parameters

java -jar runme.jar


When dialog window appears enter the URL location of the server you wish to connect to into the Database path
text box in the standard convention for java programs(\\ instead of \) 

if you wish to connect to a local server on the same machine use:

"rmi://127.0.0.1/"

Enter the port to connect on.  If connecting locally use port 0.


Selecting [Connect] will attempt to connect to the specified server and launch the applications main window.  
If a connection fails a message is returned in the text label at the bottom of the dialog box.  This dialog
