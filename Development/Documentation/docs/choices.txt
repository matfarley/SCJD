DESIGN CHOICES

at least 9 different choice points
- RMI
- MVC
- Value object
- GUI - check boxes to change search mode
- GUI controller to return TableModels
- DB - implement interface but create own methods to actually run the program how I think it should
_ use a method local inner class to build the string efficiently.  Fixes the problem
where to put the  offset and newRecord variables and how to initialize 
- chose to overwrite records in the database marked as deleted if a new record is given with the same primary key - this is so it is only possible for one record with that primary key to ever exist in the database, valid or not.!
and reset them for each record
- just  write 1 version of the database class that does locking etc even for the local version.

-Value judgements 
- descisions made



PERCEIVED PROBLEMS:
- Employing the locking code - hiw to make that work
- database - haven't manipulated or read binary files to this extent - not us
- packaging - never user Jar filesed RandomAccessFile
-didn't know rMi - not sure about creating my own stubs and skeletons
- time - quite an involved project and not much time given for its completion
- use name and city as composite primary key because they are unique


uncertainties about the project and decisions made to overcome
